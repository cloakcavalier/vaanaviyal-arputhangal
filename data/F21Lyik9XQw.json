NASA is asking people to submit their names that will be etched on a chip on board the Mars rover launching in 2020. The rover which NASA describes as a ‘robotic scientist’ will touch down on the red planet in 2021 and will search for signs of past microbial life, gather data on the planet’s climate and collects samples of Martian dirt for return to Earth. The rover marks an important step in NASA’s bigger plans to send humans to deep space. The campaign is part of an effort to raise public awareness about NASA’s activities and to inspire and educate children about space and STEM-related study. Over 400, 000 names have already been submitted but you have until September 30 to get your name on the passenger list.\n\nAll the names will be stenciled onto a silicon chip; each line of text will be smaller than one-thousandth the width of a human hair (75 nanometers). More than a million names can fit on a single dime-size chip. The engraved chips will hitch a ride on the rover under a specially designed glass cover. NASA has clear plans to send humans to Mars, and the 2020 rover mission is a key part of the journey. The other mission to help prepare a possible Mars mission is NASA's lunar mission expected to take place in 2024.\n\nNASA recently announced the next crewed mission to the moon will be called Artemis and include a female astronaut. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine announced the mission name as part of NASA’s updated budget request.",  "publishedAt": "2019-06-30T01:59:04.000Z",  "vid_src": "F21Lyik9XQw"}
