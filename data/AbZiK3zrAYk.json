Developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the mission is planned to be launched to the Moon by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III).It includes a lunar orbiter, lander and rover, all developed indigenously.\n\nChandrayaan-2 will attempt a soft landing of a lander and rover in a high plain between two craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N, at a latitude of about 70° south. The wheeled rover will move on the lunar surface and will perform on-site chemical analysis. It can relay data to Earth through the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and lander, which will fly on the same launch.\n\nLaunch of Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for 14 July 2019 at 21:21 UTC. A successful landing would make India the 4th country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the space agencies of the USA, USSR, and China. If successful, Chandrayaan-2 will be the First ever mission to soft land near the lunar south pole.",  "publishedAt": "2019-07-14T06:38:28.000Z",  "vid_src": "AbZiK3zrAYk"}
