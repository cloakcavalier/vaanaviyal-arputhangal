Rosetta's encounter revealed an intriguing object which has survived since the birth of the planets, some 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nDiscovered in 1852, Lutetia was among the first objects to be classified as an M-type (metallic) asteroid, but radar observations revealed an unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, that was inconsistent with a metallic surface. Meanwhile, spectra obtained at visible and infrared wavelengths found similarities with meteorites known as enstatite chondrites and with carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, typically associated with C-type asteroids.\n\nSince there was no consensus on the correct interpretation of its largely featureless spectrum, the Rosetta science team was delighted to have the opportunity to examine the enigmatic object during the spacecraft's second passage through the asteroid belt.\n\nThe flyby of Lutetia took place on 10 July 2010, when Rosetta sped past the huge chunk of rock at a distance of 3170 km. The scientific results of this encounter are summarised in three papers published this week in the journal Science.\n\nAs Rosetta closed on the rotating asteroid, the OSIRIS imaging system returned 462 pictures of the illuminated northern hemisphere, showing more than 50 per cent of the asteroid's surface.",  "publishedAt": "2019-08-01T01:27:46.000Z",  "vid_src": "OBSUJLK8MI0"}
