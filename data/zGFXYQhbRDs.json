Rosetta found organic compounds on the comet that support this view, including some that had never been seen on a comet before.\n\nIn detailed studies of the comet’s atmosphere, Rosetta spotted the amino acid glycine, which is commonly found in proteins, and phosphorus, a key component of DNA and cell membranes. In addition, Rosetta detected ethanol and its lander module Philae detected glycolaldehyde.\n\nRosetta also analysed cometary dust directly, which led to it revealing a form of carbon that was more complex than expected. “It is so complex, we can’t give it a proper formula or a name,” said Rosetta team member Hervé Cottin, co-author of a study published this summer that reported the result.",  "publishedAt": "2019-08-16T02:00:09.000Z",  "vid_src": "zGFXYQhbRDs"}
