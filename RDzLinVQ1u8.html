                 <p class="description">Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference without leaving Alexandria. He knew that at local noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene is at latitude 24°05′ North, near to the Tropic of Cancer, which was 23°42′ North in 100 BC.) He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water.He then measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod, known as a gnomon, and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground. Using the length of the rod, and the length of the shadow, as the legs of a triangle, he calculated the angle of the Sun's rays. This turned out to be about 7°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth's circumference was fifty times that distance.</p>

                 <p class="description">His knowledge of the size of Egypt was founded on the work of many generations of surveying trips. Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Syene and Alexandria of 5,000 stadia (a figure that was checked yearly). Some historians say that the distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. Some claim Eratosthenes used the Olympic stade of 176.4 m (579 ft), which would imply a circumference of 44,100 km (27,400 mi), an error of 10%,[20] but the 184.8 m (606 ft) Italian stade became (300 years later) the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade, which implies a circumference of 46,100 km (28,600 mi), an error of 15%. He made five important assumptions (none of which are perfectly accurate):</p>

                 <p class="description"><ul><li>That the distance between Alexandria and Syene was 5000 stadia</li></ul>
                                        <ul><li>That Alexandria is due north of Syene</li></ul>
                                        <ul><li>That Syene is on the Tropic of Cancer</li></ul>
                                        <ul><li>That the Earth is a perfect sphere</li></ul>
                                        <ul><li>That light rays emanating from the Sun are parallel.</li></ul></p>

                 <p class="description">Eratosthenes later rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia, likely for reasons of calculation simplicity as the larger number is evenly divisible by 60. In 2012, Anthony Abreu Mora repeated Eratosthenes's calculation with more accurate data; the result was 40,074 km (24,901 mi), which is 66 km (41 mi) different (0.16%) from the currently accepted polar circumference of the Earth.</p>
